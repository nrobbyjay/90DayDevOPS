⚔️ Day 4 Challenge: Bash Scripting Battle
🧠 Scenario:
You're working on a Linux server as a junior DevOps engineer. Your manager asks you to automate a daily report that checks system health and creates a simple backup.

🧩 Your Mission:
Write a Bash script called daily_ops.sh that:

Checks disk space usage

Use df -h

If any partition is above 80%, print a warning

Pings google.com

If the ping fails, log: "No internet - $(date)" to a file called netcheck.log

Creates a backup of /etc directory

The backup should be named like: etc-backup-YYYY-MM-DD.tar.gz

Logs the script execution

Append the current date/time to ops.log every time the script is run

📝 Rules:
Use functions for each task

Script should be executable

Must be written in pure Bash (#!/bin/bash)

No external dependencies beyond standard Linux tools

🎯 BONUS Challenge:
Schedule it to run daily using crontab (Day 5 sneak peek).
